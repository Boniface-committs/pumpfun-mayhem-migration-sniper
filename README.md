- **Speed**: Execute faster than competitors
- **Profit Maximization**: Capture maximum value during migration
- **Automation**: No manual monitoring required
- **Risk Management**: Built-in filters and safety mechanisms
- **Competitive Edge**: Outperform manual traders

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Solana wallet with sufficient SOL balance
- Private RPC endpoint (critical for speed)
- High-performance server/low latency connection

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gigi0500/pumpfun-mayhem-migration-sniper.git
cd pumpfun-mayhem-migration-sniper
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure your wallet private key
3. Set private RPC endpoint (essential for speed)
4. Configure migration detection sensitivity
5. Set position sizing and risk limits
6. Configure token filters

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

## Sample Transaction

```
Sample TX: [Your transaction hash will be added here]
```

## How It Works

1. **Continuous Scanning**: Monitor all PumpFun tokens 24/7
2. **Bonding Curve Analysis**: Calculate exact migration timing
3. **Pre-Migration Alert**: Identify tokens approaching migration
4. **Position Preparation**: Pre-approve and prepare transactions
5. **Migration Sniping**: Execute trade at exact migration moment
6. **Post-Migration Management**: Handle position after migration

## Performance Tips

- Use private RPC for lowest latency
- Deploy on server close to Solana validators
- Pre-approve transactions when possible
- Monitor network congestion
- Adjust priority fees for speed

## Security

- **Never share your private keys**
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Verify all parameters before execution
- Monitor bot activity continuously
- Test with small amounts first

## Disclaimer

This bot is for educational purposes. Trading cryptocurrencies involves substantial risk. Migration sniping requires precise timing and can be highly volatile. Use at your own risk and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
